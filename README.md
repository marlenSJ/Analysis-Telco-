We have been assigned the task of identifying customers at risk of churn, and proposing a solution to limit churn. To adress this problem we are perfoming a Exploratory Data Analysis as first step and then preparating our data to train a Random Forest Classifier. During this we identified that the variables that provide more information to the model are: tenure (the time a person has been a customer), month-to-month contract, and total charges.
